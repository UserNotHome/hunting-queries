KQL queries for Microsoft Sentinel and Defender XDR

This repository is for sharing KQL queries that Threat Hunters and Detection Engineers can easily pick up and understand. These queries are designed for hunting and in some cases can be developed into a detection use case with some additional tuning and modification. Not all events returned by these queries should generate an alert. Additional context should be gathered to determine if a log is malicious. Anyone is free to use these queries. A reference to GitHub @UserNotHome is much appreciated when doing so.
